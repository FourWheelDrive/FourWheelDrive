### Hello!

I'm an Electrical Engineering student who got hooked on web games at the tail end of high school. I've been developing much more in HTML5 and Javascript recently!

I'm currently working on better web responsiveness and more pleasant typography. Check out my [portfolio website](fourwheeldrive.github.io)!
Where time allows, I'd like to learn server-side coding with Node.js and SQL to make my websites more dynamic.
