## Hello!
I'm an Electrical Engineering student who got hooked on web games at the tail end of high school. I've been developing much more in HTML5 and Javascript recently!

# What am I working on?
I'm currently working on better web responsiveness and more pleasant typography. Check out my [portfolio website](https://fourwheeldrive.github.io/)!
Where time allows, I'd like to learn server-side coding with Node.js and SQL to make my websites more dynamic.

# What are your favourite web games?
Universal Paperclips is excellent! You can play it here: [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html)
Untrusted is a cool coding game where you use JavaScript to solve puzzles! You can play it here: [Untrusted by Alex Nisnevich and Greg Shuflin](http://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/)
